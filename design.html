    The Hero Hand lets any user become a superhero in just a few seconds! The device houses a foam dart launching system, wearable by the user on their hand. The Hero Hand was designed with the goal of bringing superhero powers to life for children and making it easy for them to play projectile-launching games even if they had limited motor capabilities.</p>

    The Home Pinball Controller is an interactive user-interface for pinball. It provides physical, in-real-life feedback to the pinball bumpers as well as a realistic plunger that simulates an arcade pinball machine, making a far more immersive experience than simply pressing buttons on a keyboard.</p>
