# 610webportfolio
This is my repo for my ENGCMP 0610 web portfolio. At this stage of the project, I have mapped out how I want the website to look, but have not inserted content or done much CSS styling.

I am planning on making a job-seeking portfolio to use when applying to internships and special programs. The field that I want to work in is broadcast engineering, but most summer internships for students with my major are in industries like robotics, energy, or automation. I want the portfolio to be equally as effective no matter which kind of job I am applying for.

I'm currently planning to separate my radio work into its own, easy-to-locate category on the website. The more general engineering work that I've done will be divided up into smaller categories, since they will be applicable to more jobs and I want employers to know I have experience in multiple important aspects of engineering. I am also planning on including a section of coursework and work experience that may not have deliverables associated with it, so that employers will still know that I have experience in the fields they are related to.
