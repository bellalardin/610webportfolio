    <h2>Engineering (General)</h2>
      <h3>ENGR 0501: Music Engineering Laboratory</h3>
        <p>Introduction to recording engineering supplemented with lectures on the engineering of music. Learned how to record, edit, and produce tracks within Digital Performer software, basics of recording engineering, and how to use equipment around the lab. Learned about the physics of music and mechanical/electronic function of musical instruments.</p>
      <h3>ENGR 0716: Art of Hands-On System Design Engineering</h3>
        <p>Hands-on introductory design course with a focus on user-centric design principles. Learned basic engineering skills including soldering, Arduino coding, drilling, tapping, and design using automated systems. Researched current engineering issues, conducted in-depth user outreach and testing, delivered weekly presentations, created sketches and models of designs, completed several short-term and long-term design projects, both individually and with teams. Projects can be viewed <a href="design.html">here.</a></p>

    <h2>Electrical Engineering</h2>
      <h3>ECE 0101: Linear Circuits and Systems</h3>
        <p>Introduction to linear circuit analysis. Learned basic electrical engineering concepts and used methods such as mesh current analysis, nodal voltage analysis, Thevenin and Norton equivalent circuits, and Kirchoff's and Ohm's laws to solve a variety of DC and AC circuits. Used voltmeters, waveform generators, oscilloscopes, and other lab equipment to build and analyze various circuits.</p>
      <h3>ECE 0201: Digital Circuits and Systems</h3>
        <p>Introduction to digital circuit design. Studied boolean algebra, binary and hexadecimal numbers, a variety of combinational and sequential logic circuits, and finite state machines. Learned basic breadboarding skills and basics of VHDL. Designed simple circuits using breadboards and chips, as well as more complex circuits using VHDL, including counters, decoders, and finite state machines.</p>
      <h3>ECE 0301: ECE Problem Solving With C++</h3>
        <p>Introductory C++ course. Topics covered include loops, files, functions, pointers, vectors, classes, inheritance, and polymorphism, among other basic C++ concepts. Created programs to evaluate logic statements, perform operations using Boolean algebra, perform matrix-vector multiplication, analyze basic circuits, create sinusoidal signals, and perform sorting algorithms. Analyzed real-life case studies related to the IEEE code of ethics and discussed how to be an ethical engineer.</p>
